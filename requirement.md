Your task is to create a UI to view a wallet’s subaccounts and their balances, perp positions and open orders. If you do not want to use your own funds to create a Drift account and populate with data, you may request a wallet from us to view that wallet’s data instead. However, there is still an expectation to integrate the Solana wallet adapter.
